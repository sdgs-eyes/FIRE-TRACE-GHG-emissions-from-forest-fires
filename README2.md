Wildfires have a long list of socioeconomic impacts, including material and human losses, biodiversity loss, and the advancement of desertification, among others. In addition to these direct impacts, wildfires are also a significant source of pollutant emissions that severely affect air quality and thus public health. Among the main pollutants generated by wildfires are **carbon monoxide (CO)**, a toxic gas released in large quantities due to the incomplete combustion of biomass, and **nitrogen dioxide (NO₂)**, formed in the atmosphere from the reaction of compounds such as **nitric oxide (NO)** and **nitrogen monoxide (NO)**. Additionally, large amounts of **sulfur dioxide (SO₂)**, a gas that contributes to acid rain formation, and **carbon dioxide (CO₂)**, one of the main greenhouse gases, are emitted.

Wildfires also generate suspended particles, especially **fine particulate matter (PM2.5)**, which can penetrate deep into the lungs, causing respiratory problems, and reach the bloodstream, leading to various cardiovascular conditions. The combination of these pollutants creates a significant burden on ecosystems, the atmosphere, and exposed populations, especially in areas close to the fires or under the influence of air currents that carry these emissions.

In this tutorial, we will showcase a new methodology that allow us to assess emissions from wildfires in Italy using a variety of Earth Observation data from the Copernicus service.

### Used Datasets

The Copernicus Service offers a wide variety of environmental data that can be used for multiple purposes. The available products include observational data, remote sensing, modeling, ocean and climate indicators, etc. Each type of data has its own characteristics, such as spatial and temporal resolution, available variables (physical, chemical, biogeochemical), frequency of database updates, and more.

By leveraging Copernicus data, the workflow presented here provides high spatial and temporal coverage, allowing us to assess GHG emissions across the entire study area, for a year of choice.

This script provides the functions used to calculate GHG emissions from forest fires. GHG emissions (CO₂ + NO₂ + CH₄) are calculated using the IPCC equation (2006):

where:  
**L<sub>fire</sub>** = amount of GHGs released as a result of fire [kgton of GHG];  
**A** = burnt area [ha], provided by EFFIS Burn data product  
**M<sub>v</sub>** = mass of available fuels, in [kg dry matter ha⁻¹], provided by Corine Land Cover level IV crosslinked with INFC carbon pools  
**C<sub>f</sub>** = combustion factor, portion of biomass combusted [dimensionless], derived from EFFIS Fire severity product and the biomass efficiency model calibrated for Italy (Aquino et al., 202X)  
**G<sub>ef</sub>** = emission factor [g GHG kg⁻¹] for each GHG compound, taken by the NEIVAv1.0 database

### Set up

The first step to working with Python interpreters is usually to import all the necessary tools and libraries from the Jupyter Notebook ecosystem. The following cell compiles all the libraries that will be used during the tutorial:

**General Note**: Execute each cell through the ▶ button from the top MENU (or keyboard shortcut `Shift` + `Enter`).
