# Service 13.10 - GHG emissions from forest fires

This indicator considers past GHG emission trends from forest fires in Europe and indicates the progress of the EU towards its international and internal GHG targets. This indicator is expressed as CO2 equivalents using the global warming potential (GWP) of main gases emitted during forest fires and the computation is performed following IPCC guidelines. 

An automatic computation of GHG emissions from forest fires based on information on EO-based burnt area and forest type pre-existing biomass is provided here.
